# hopfieldC

![](https://github.com/gannont14/hopfieldC/blob/main/example.gif)

This is a project based on a hopfield network that I learned about in one of my Artificial Intelligence classes.

The network is similar to what is used in Content Addressable Memory, and allows you to effectively 'memorize' certain patterns based on partial or distorted versions of them. 

This version is built in pure C with some standard libraries, as well as raylib to do graphics and make the pattern creation process easier
